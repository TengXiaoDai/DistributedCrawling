mmh3
====

Python wrapper for MurmurHash (MurmurHash3), a set of fast and robust hash functions.

mmh3 2.3.1 supports both Python 2.7 and 3.x.

Usage
-----

Sample Usage::

    >>> import mmh3
    >>> mmh3.hash('foo') # 32 bit signed int
    -156908512
    >>> mmh3.hash64('foo') # two 64 bit signed ints
    (-2129773440516405919, 9128664383759220103)
    >>> mmh3.hash128('foo') # 128 bit signed int
    168394135621993849475852668931176482145
    >>> mmh3.hash_bytes('foo') # 128 bit value as bytes
    'aE\xf5\x01W\x86q\xe2\x87}\xba+\xe4\x87\xaf~'
    >>> mmh3.hash('foo', 42) # uses 42 for its seed
    -1322301282

``hash64``, ``hash128``, and ``hash_bytes`` have the third argument for architecture optimization. Use True for x64 and False for x86 (default: True).::

    >>> mmh3.hash64('foo', 42, True) 
    (-840311307571801102, -6739155424061121879)

Changes
=======
2.3.1 (2015-06-07)
------------------
* Fix compile errors for gcc >=5.

2.3 (2013-12-08)
----------------
* Add ``hash128``, which returns a 128-bit signed integer.
* Fix a misplaced operator which could cause memory leak in a rare condition.
* Fix a malformed value to a Python/C API function which may cause runtime errors in recent Python 3.x versions.

The first two commits are from `Derek Wilson <https://github.com/underrun>`_. Thanks!

2.2 (2013-03-03)
----------------
* Improve portability to support systems with old gcc (version < 4.4) such as CentOS/RHEL 5.x. (Commit from `Micha Gorelick <https://github.com/mynameisfiber>`_. Thanks!)

2.1 (2013-02-25)
----------------

* Add `__version__` constant. Check if it exists when the following revision matters for your application.
* Incorporate the revision r147, which includes robustness improvement and minor tweaks.

Beware that due to this revision, **the result of 32-bit version of 2.1 is NOT the same as that of 2.0**. E.g.,::

    >>> mmh3.hash('foo') # in mmh3 2.0
    -292180858
    >>> mmh3.hash('foo') # in mmh3 2.1
    -156908512

The results of hash64 and hash_bytes remain unchanged. Austin Appleby, the author of Murmurhash, ensured this revision was the final modification to MurmurHash3's results and any future changes would be to improve performance only.
